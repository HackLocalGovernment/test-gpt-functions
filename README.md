# Test GPT functions

A little playground for trying out GPT-4 assistant functions.

[![Mutation testing badge](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?style=flat&url=https%3A%2F%2Fbadge-api.stryker-mutator.io%2Fgithub.com%2FHAckLocalGovernment%2Ftest-gpt-functions%2Fdevelop)](https://dashboard.stryker-mutator.io/reports/github.com/HackLocalGovernment/test-gpt-functions/develop)

For now, this will listen for JSON pasted on stdin and will reply with JSON on stdout which can be pasted into the GPT playground.

~~Setup~~
-----

~~Before running, you will need to setup a file `.env` which contains:~~

~~`OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI api key which will be used to call the OpenAI API.~~

For now, the app will now use the OpenAI API - just copy and paste from playground.

`exit` or `CTRL-D` to exit.
